"""The dashboard card as a Lovelace resource.

The main bundle is also loaded as an extra frontend module, but in the companion app a dashboard may be drawn
before that module has arrived; the card then stays "Custom element doesn't exist: nextfloor-card" until the
sidebar page is opened (#252). Lovelace waits for its resources before it draws cards, so the card's bundle is
kept in the resource list as well, in storage mode only (YAML resources belong to the user).
